THINGS THAT THE CONTAINERS SHARE WITH THE HOST

Here are the things that I found are shared from the containers to the host from this exercise:

1. Network interfaces: Containers can communicate with the host, other containers, or the outside world (i.e., exposed ports) through a shared network interface. Each container can be assigned an IP address, and communication can be made through it.

2. File system: Containers have their isolated file system. The host can access the containers' file systems; with it, containers' data can persist even after the container stops.

3. Processes: The host has access to the running processes on each container. 

4. System resources: Containers share the host's kernel and its resources, including CPU and memory. This shared kernel allows containers to run efficiently.

Additional things that are shared:

5. Environment Variables: It's possible to access certain environment variables for the containers. These can be keys, shared secrets, etc. to run in the containers.
